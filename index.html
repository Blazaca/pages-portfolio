                    Before Coding Temple I was trained as a Sound Engineer for concerts and other productions
                    like musical theatre since middle school. This took me to Florida for certified training
                    that helped me end up at Clair Global in Pennsylvania. I was touring for 3 years total
                    traveling with the likes of Florance and the Machine, Meek Mill feat. Future, Kanye West,
                    Travis Scott, and more..<br><br>
                    When Covid started in 2020 touring came to a halt leaving me without work for more than a year
                    and a half. This left me with the<br>
                    choice to either continue my career touring or look for something more steady. Here is where coding
                    came into play. I had always had interest in computers since I was a child and the incredible versatility
                    that comes with it. With plently of Youtube as a resource I had learned more and more about what's
                    possible and it has wanted me to take advantage of that so I can start creating.
                    Coding Temple showed up on a data science website that gave me the flag in my mind that I should
                    move onto another career.
                    Getting through this class will give me a huge head start in my achieving my goals.
